The **System Security Services Daemon** (*SSSD*) is a system service to access remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It connects a local system (an SSSD _client_) to an external back-end system (a _provider_). This provides the SSSD client with access to identity and authentication remote services using an SSSD provider. For example, these remote services include: an LDAP directory, an Identity Management (IdM) or Active Directory (AD) domain, or a Kerberos realm.
