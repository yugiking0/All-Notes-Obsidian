## Definition and Purpose of Security Frameworks

![[Pasted image 20231222175635.png]]

A security framework is a structured and comprehensive approach that is designed to establish guidelines, best practices, and standards for ensuring the security of information, systems, networks, and assets within an organization.

A security framework’s purpose is to provide a systematic and organized methodology for identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks, and to facilitate consistent and effective security management across an organization.

Security frameworks often provide detailed guidance, controls, and specific products or technologies that organizations can consider for implementation. It's important to tailor the framework to the organization's unique needs and environment.

It's important to note that specific products that are associated with security frameworks can include documentation templates, assessment tools, training materials, and consulting services. These products aid organizations in implementing and complying with the guidelines of their chosen framework.

## Components of a Security Framework

The key components of a security framework typically include:

- **Policies and Procedures:** Security frameworks outline policies and procedures that define the rules, responsibilities, and actions that must be taken to protect sensitive information and systems. These policies cover areas such as data classification, access control, incident response, and more.
    
- **Risk Management:** Security frameworks help organizations assess and manage security risks by providing methodologies for identifying vulnerabilities, assessing potential threats and determining the potential impact of security incidents.
    
- **Security Controls:** Security controls are specific measures and mechanisms that are implemented to safeguard information and systems. These controls can include technical controls (firewalls, encryption), administrative controls (access control policies, security awareness training), and physical controls (surveillance, access badges).
    
- **Compliance:** Many security frameworks are designed to help organizations meet regulatory requirements and industry standards. They provide guidelines that align with legal and industry-specific security mandates, ensuring that organizations remain compliant with relevant laws and regulations.
    
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Security frameworks emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and assessment of security measures. Regular reviews and audits help identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities, allowing organizations to adapt and improve their security posture.
    
- **Incident Response:** These frameworks establish procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents. They ensure that organizations are prepared to effectively manage and mitigate the impact of security breaches.
    
- **Training and Awareness:** Security frameworks often stress the importance of educating employees about security best practices and risks. Training programs and awareness campaigns help cultivate a security-conscious culture within the organization.
    
- **Vendor Management:** Sometimes, security frameworks address third-party vendor relationships. They provide guidelines for evaluating the security practices of vendors and ensuring that their products and services meet the organization's security requirements.

## Importance of Adopting Standardized Security Frameworks

These frameworks provide a structured and systematic approach to managing and mitigating security risks. Given your interest in professional training, let's delve into the importance of adopting these frameworks and some notable products that are available to help with this process:

- **Consistency:** *( Tính nhất quán)* Standardized security frameworks, such as the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**, the **CISA Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM)** and **CIS Controls** provide a consistent set of guidelines and best practices. This consistency ensures that security measures are applied uniformly across an organization's systems and processes, reducing the risk of oversight or gaps in security.
    
- **Risk Management:** (***Quản trị rủi ro***) These frameworks are designed to help organizations identify, assess, and manage security risks effectively. By following a structured approach to risk management, businesses can prioritize their efforts and allocate resources where they are most needed.
    
- **Compliance:** *( **Tính tuân thủ** / Sự phục tùng/ Bằng lòng)* Many industries have regulatory requirements for security and data protection. Standardized frameworks provide a roadmap for compliance, helping organizations avoid legal and financial repercussions. For instance, the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** in Europe mandates specific security practices for handling personal data.
    
- **Communication:** Standardized frameworks enable clearer communication between various teams within an organization. When everyone follows the same guidelines, discussions about security become more meaningful and productive, leading to better decision-making.
    
- **Continuous Improvement:** *( **Cải tiến liên tục**)* These frameworks promote a culture of continuous improvement by providing a structured approach to evaluating and enhancing security practices over time. Regular assessments and reviews ensure that security measures stay up-to-date and effective against evolving threats.

## Common Security Frameworks

![[Pasted image 20231222180645.png | 600]]

- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):** NIST is a U.S. government agency that develops and publishes various standards and guidelines, including cybersecurity standards and guidelines. One of the most well-known frameworks developed by NIST is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). This framework provides guidelines for organizations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.
    
    The figure below shows the CSF Functions wheel, which has 6 related functions. GOVERN is in the center of the wheel because it informs how an organization will implement the other five functions. Actions supporting GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, and DETECT should all happen continuously, and actions supporting RESPOND and RECOVER should be ready always and happen when cybersecurity incidents occur.
    
    Example of how the functions inter-relate: An organization will categorize assets under IDENTIFY and take steps to secure those assets under PROTECT. Investments in planning and testing in the GOVERN and IDENTIFY functions will support timely incident response and recovery actions for cybersecurity incidents in the RESPOND and RECOVER functions.
    
- **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA):** CISA is another U.S. government agency responsible for enhancing the cybersecurity posture of the nation's critical infrastructure. CISA provides various resources and frameworks to help organizations improve their cybersecurity practices. One such framework is the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program, which aims to provide continuous monitoring and risk assessment of information systems.
    
- **Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA):** DISA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for providing IT and communication support to the military. DISA has developed the Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), which are guidelines for securing computer systems and software. These guides provide detailed configuration and security settings to ensure that systems meet specific security requirements.

While NIST, CISA and DISA are United States government organizations that have commonly used security frameworks, there are other security frameworks that can be used.

Depending on the type of business your company provides, or its location, you might have to implement many of the standards that are present in these standards as well:

- **ISO 27001:** An international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach for managing and protecting sensitive information within an organization. ISO 27001 outlines a comprehensive set of controls and best practices to establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain, and improve information security management.
    
- **CIS Controls:** The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls is a set of best practices for improving an organization's cybersecurity posture. These controls are divided into three implementation groups based on the organization's resources and risk profile. They cover various aspects of cybersecurity, including inventory and control of hardware and software assets, continuous vulnerability management, and secure configuration for hardware and software.
    
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):** While not a traditional security framework, HIPAA is a U.S. law that includes security requirements for protecting electronic protected health information (ePHI). The Security Rule within HIPAA outlines specific administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that covered entities and business associates must implement to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.
