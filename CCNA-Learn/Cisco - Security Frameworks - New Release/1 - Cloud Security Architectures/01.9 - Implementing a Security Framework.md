# Implementing a Security Framework

In the **Assessment Phase** you will identify what needs to be protected, the threats that might affect these assets, and where your assets might be the most vulnerable. These assets are what will need the most protection on your network. By identifying them before you build your policy, you are less likely to miss any critical or vulnerable assets that might otherwise not receive the security that is required. This phase includes the following:

- **Identify Assets:** List all digital assets, including databases, servers, applications, and data repositories.
    
- **Threat Assessment:** Analyze potential threats such as cyberattacks, data breaches, insider threats, and natural disasters.
    
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identify vulnerabilities in your systems and applications through penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

The **Policy Development** phase consists of creating the policies that your security deployment must adhere to. You first have to identify the assets that must be protected, the threats to these assets, and the vulnerabilities that might exist within the assets. Afterward, you will build policies that will be used to protect your resources including:

- **Access Control Policies:** Define who can access specific resources and under what conditions.
    
- **Data Classification:** Categorize data based on sensitivity levels and define access controls accordingly.
    
- **Password Policies:** Establish password complexity requirements, regular changes, and multifactor authentication (MFA).
    
- **Incident Response Plan:** Create a detailed plan to handle security incidents, including communication protocols and escalation procedures.
    

Once your policies have been defined, you will use them to implement your security in the **Security Measures Implementation Phase**. While not limited to these items, some of the key security measures that will be implemented include:

- **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems:** Set up firewalls to monitor and filter network traffic. Implement IDS/IPS to detect and block suspicious activities.
    
- **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using protocols like HTTPS, TLS, and next generation encryption algorithms.
    
- **Endpoint Security:** Install antivirus, anti-malware, and endpoint protection software on all devices.
    
- **Patch Management:** Regularly update software, operating systems and applications to address security vulnerabilities.
    
- **Network Visibility:** Using protocols like NetFlow, send network statistics to a network visibility tool. This step will allow you to verify network operations.

It is important that your security team and regular employees understand the importance of the security measures that are in place, so you must provide **Security Awareness Training**. If employees are not trained and tested on the defined security measures, they are likely to introduce security vulnerabilities that will affect your network. Security awareness might include the following:

- **Employee Training:** Provide mandatory security training for all employees to educate them about phishing, social engineering and safe online practices.
    
- **Simulated Phishing:** Conduct periodic simulated phishing campaigns to assess employees' susceptibility and enhance their awareness.
    
Even with the best security measures in place, you must monitor your network for security violations, so the next phase can be referred to as the **Monitoring and Detection Phase**. This phase will require the tools and personnel to ensure that the security measures that are in place are effective. This phase might include:

- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Implement a SIEM system to centralize logs, monitor events and detect anomalies in real-time.

- **Log Analysis:** Regularly review logs and analyze trends to identify potential security breaches or irregularities.


When a security incident occurs, it is vital that you are equipped to respond to the event immediately. You must also have an **Incident Response and Recovery** plan in place that allows you to recover from a security incident as quickly as possible. Steps that need to be taken before a security event occurs include creating the following:

- **Incident Handling Team:** Form a dedicated team to manage security incidents. Follow the incident response plan and minimize damage.
  
- **Data Backups:** Establish a robust backup system with regular automated backups to enable quick recovery if there is data loss.

Threats to your resources are ever evolving and there is no time to rest. The security needs of your network must be able to address the new security threats that are in the process of being developed or discovered by bad actors worldwide. To ensure that you will be ready for new threats as they are introduced, you can implement the **Continuous Improvement Phase** by doing the following:

- **Regular Audits and Assessments:** Conduct periodic security audits and assessments to identify gaps and areas for improvement.
   
- **Update Policies:** Keep security policies up to date to address emerging threats and technological changes.

- **Learning from Incidents:** After an incident, conduct a thorough analysis to identify root causes and implement preventive measures.

For the final phase, **Third-party Vendor Security Assessment**, keep the following points in mind:

- Evaluate the security practices of third-party vendors before integrating their services or products into your environment.
   
- When conducting a vendor security assessment using different security products, it's essential to tailor your approach to your organization's needs and the specific vendors you're assessing. By using various security solutions, you can enhance your ability to evaluate and manage the security risks that are associated with third-party vendors effectively.
   
- While the Cisco security portfolio is designed to work as a compete security solution, the use of third-party vendors is also supported. If you already have some third-party security products in place, they can be augmented with the available Cisco products to complete the implementation of your security framework.
   
- Remember that the choice of specific security products should be based on your organization's existing security infrastructure, requirements, and budget.
