### Cable Types and Standards


|Cable Type|Standard|Application|
|---|---|---|
|Ethernet Straight-through|Both ends T568A or both ends T568B|Connects a network host to a network device such as a switch or hub|
|Ethernet Crossover|One end T568A, other end T568B|Connects two network hosts Connects two network intermediary devices (switch to switch or router to router)|
|Rollover|Cisco proprietary|Connects a workstation serial port to a router console port, using an adapter|

## Types of Wireless Media
- **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)** - Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology, commonly referred to as Wi-Fi. WLAN uses a contention-based protocol known as carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). The wireless NIC must first listen before transmitting to determine if the radio channel is clear. If another wireless device is transmitting, then the NIC must wait until the channel is clear. Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance. Wi-Fi is used with certified WLAN devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.
- **Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15)** - This is a wireless personal area network (WPAN) standard, commonly known as “Bluetooth.” It uses a device pairing process to communicate over distances from 1 to 100 meters.
