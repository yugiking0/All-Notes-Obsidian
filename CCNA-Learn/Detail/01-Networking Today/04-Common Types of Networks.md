# Common Types of Networks
## Networks of Many Sizes
- **Small Home Networks** : Small home networks connect a few computers to each other and to the internet.
- **Small Office and Home Office Networks** : The SOHO network allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network, or access centralized, shared resources.
- **Medium to Large Networks** : Medium to large networks, such as those used by corporations and schools, can have many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts.
- **World Wide Networks** : The internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers world-wide.
## LANs and WANs
Network infrastructures vary greatly in terms of:
- Size of the area covered
- Number of users connected
- Number and types of services available
- Area of responsibility
The two most common types of network infrastructures are Local Area Networks (LANs), and Wide Area Networks (WANs). A LAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area. A LAN is typically used in a department within an enterprise, a home, or a small business network. A WAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to other networks over a wide geographical area, which is typically owned and managed by a larger corporation or a telecommunications service provider.

**LANs**
A LAN is a network infrastructure that spans a small geographical area. LANs have specific characteristics:
- LANs interconnect end devices in a limited area such as a home, school, office building, or campus.
- A LAN is usually administered by a single organization or individual. Administrative control is enforced at the network level and governs the security and access control policies.
- LANs provide high-speed bandwidth to internal end devices and intermediary devices, as shown in the figure.

**WANs**
The figure shows a WAN which interconnects two LANs. A WAN is a network infrastructure that spans a wide geographical area. WANs are typically managed by service providers (SPs) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
WANs have specific characteristics:
- WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents.
- WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
- WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.
## The Internet
Some of the LAN examples are connected to each other through a WAN connection. WANs are then connected to each other. The red WAN connection lines represent all the varieties of ways we connect networks. WANs can connect through copper wires, fiber-optic cables, and wireless transmissions (not shown).

**The internet is not owned by any individual or group**

## Intranets and Extranets
- There are two other terms which are similar to the term internet: intranet and extranet.
- **Intranet** is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization. An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization.

- An organization may use **an extranet** to provide secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organizationâ€™s data. Here are some examples of extranets:

- A company that is providing access to outside suppliers and contractors
- A hospital that is providing a booking system to doctors so they can make appointments for their patients
- A local office of education that is providing budget and personnel information to the schools in its district
