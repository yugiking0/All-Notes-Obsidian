# Network Representations and Topologies

## Network Representations
- **Network Interface Card (NIC)** - A NIC physically connects the end device to the network.
- **Physical Port** - A connector or outlet on a networking device where the media connects to an end device or another networking device.
- **Interface** - Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks. Because routers connect networks, the ports on a router are referred to as network interfaces.
## Topology Diagrams
- **Physical Topology Diagrams**

- Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation, as shown in the figure. You can see that the rooms in which these devices are located are labeled in this physical topology.

- **Logical Topology Diagrams**

- Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network, as shown in the figure. You can see which end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.
