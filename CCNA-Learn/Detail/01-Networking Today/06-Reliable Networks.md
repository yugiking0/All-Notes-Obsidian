# Reliable Networks
As networks evolve, we have learned that there are four basic characteristics that network architects must address to meet user expectations:
- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- Security

## Fault Tolerance
- A fault tolerant network is one that limits the number of affected devices during a failure. It is built to allow quick recovery when such a failure occurs

## Scalability
- A scalable network expands quickly to support new users and applications. It does this without degrading the performance of services that are being accessed by existing users

## Quality of Service
- Quality of Service (QoS) is an increasing requirement of networks today. New applications available to users over networks, such as voice and live video transmissions, create higher expectations for the quality of the delivered services

## Network Security
- The network infrastructure, services, and the data contained on network-attached devices are crucial personal and business assets. Network administrators must address two types of network security concerns: network infrastructure security and information security.

- **Confidentiality** ***(Bảo mật)*** - Data confidentiality means that only the intended and authorized recipients can access and read data.
- **Integrity** ***(Tính toàn vẹn)*** - Data integrity assures users that the information has not been altered in transmission, from origin to destination.
- **Availability** ***(Tính sẵn sàng)*** - Data availability assures users of timely and reliable access to data services for authorized users.
