# Network Security
## Security Threats
There are several common external threats to networks:
- **Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses** - These contain malicious software or code running on a user device.
- **Spyware and adware** - These are types of software which are installed on a user’s device. The software then secretly collects information about the user.
- **Zero-day attacks** - Also called zero-hour attacks, these occur on the first day that a vulnerability becomes known.
- **Threat actor attacks** - A malicious person attacks user devices or network resources.
- **Denial of service attacks** - These attacks slow or crash applications and processes on a network device.
- **Data interception and theft** - This attack captures private information from an organization’s network.
- **Identity theft** - This attack steals the login credentials of a user in order to access private data.

## Security Solutions
These are the basic security components for a home or small office network:
- **Antivirus and antispyware** - These applications help to protect end devices from becoming infected with malicious software.
- **Firewall filtering** - Firewall filtering blocks unauthorized access into and out of the network. This may include a host-based firewall system that prevents unauthorized access to the end device, or a basic filtering service on the home router to prevent unauthorized access from the outside world into the network.

Larger networks and corporate networks use antivirus, antispyware, and firewall filtering, but they also have other security requirements:
- **Dedicated firewall systems** - These provide more advanced firewall capabilities that can filter large amounts of traffic with more granularity.
- **Access control lists (ACL)** - These further filter access and traffic forwarding based on IP addresses and applications.
- **Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)** - These identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks.
- **Virtual private networks (VPN)** - These provide secure access into an organization for remote workers.
